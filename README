I have been working on extending the functionality of Video-JS.

After talking to Steve of the Video-JS project I choose to show
off a few examples of how you can extend Video-JS.  There are two
basic plugins included.

<ul>
<li>add a replay at the end of play</li>
<li>social media buttons to post video to your favorite social media network</li>
</ul>

You may need to modify the code a bit to work for your
purposes, but it should be far enough along that it helps
you get started.  If people take an interest I will continue
to update it.

This is a very basic commit, you will need to modify the 
images referenced in the css.  I wasn't sure of the rights 
with the ones I am using.  They were listed as free to use, 
but I need to check on the details.
